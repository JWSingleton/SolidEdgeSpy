SolidEdgeSpy
================

Spy for Solid Edge is an open source .NET application written in C# that connects to a running instance of Solid Edge and exposes the underlying runtime COM API visually.

Solid Edge has a very large object model making it difficult to visualize and learn. The application greatly simplifies the process of learning the object model for beginners while also being useful to experts.

##Background
